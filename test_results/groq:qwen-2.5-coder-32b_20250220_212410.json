    "response": "# Binary Search Tree (BST)\n\nA Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:\n- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node\u2019s key.\n- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node\u2019s key.\n- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.\n\n## Characteristics\n- Each node in a BST can have at most two\u5b50\u5973 (children).\n- The key of each node is greater than the keys in its left subtree and less than the keys in its right subtree.\n- A BST can handle duplicate values; however, to keep the tree simple, it is often chosen not to allow duplicate keys.\n\n## Basic Operations\n- **Insertion**: To insert a new key into the BST, compare the key with the root's key. If the key is less, recur for the left subtree. Otherwise, recur for the right subtree. O(h) where h is the height of the tree.\n- **Deletion**: To delete a key from BST, first find the node and then delete it.  \n  - Node to be deleted is leaf: Simply remove from the tree.\n  - Node to be deleted has only one child: Copy the child to the node and delete the child.\n  - Node to be deleted has two children: Find the inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree) of the node. Copy contents of the inorder successor to the node and delete the inorder successor.\n- **Search**: To search a given key in a BST, start from the root and recursively traverse the right or left subtree according to the comparison with the key. O(h) where h is the height of the tree.\n\n## Code Example (Python)\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, key):\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n        self.val = key\n\ndef insert(root, key):\n    # If the tree is empty, return a new node\n    if root is None:\n        return Node(key)\n\n    # Otherwise, recur down the tree\n    if key < root.val:\n        root.left = insert(root.left, key)\n    else:\n        root.right = insert(root.right, key)\n\n    # return the (unchanged) node pointer\n    return root\n\ndef inorder_traversal(root):\n    if root is not None:\n        inorder_traversal(root.left)\n        print(root.val)\n        inorder_traversal(root.right)\n\n# Driver program to test the above functions\nroot = None\nkeys = [50, 30, 20, 40, 70, 60, 80]\n\nfor key in keys:\n    root = insert(root, key)\n\n# Let's print inorder traversal of the BST\nprint(\"Inorder traversal of the given tree\")\ninorder_traversal(root)\n```\n\nThis code snippet defines a simple Binary Search Tree with insertion and in-order traversal functionalities. Running this code will construct the BST from the provided keys and print out the keys of the tree in sorted order using an in-order traversal.",

Each gateway can forward requests to one or more Rate Limiting Services, which can independently track and process requests.\n  \n- **Fault Tolerance**: \n  - For APIs that have limited availability or cannot tolerate downtime, we can implement redundancy for both the Rate Limiting Services and API Gateway layers.\n  - The use of distributed cache in conjunction with persistent storage ensures data safety and availability during failures.\n  \n- **Consistency**:\n  - Consistent rate limiting decisions across all instances (Rate Limiting Service instances) through central or distributed caching mechanisms.\n  - Consistent configuration storage in the persistent layer.\n\n##  Rate Limiting Algorithms\n\n- **Token Bucket**: Distributed Cache manages token buckets. Each token represents a certain unit of the resource to be limited. Tokens are added to each bucket at a fixed rate. Consuming a request means taking tokens from the bucket. If there are enough tokens, the request proceeds; otherwise, it is blocked until tokens become available.\n\n- **Leaky Bucket**: Each API Gateway routes requests into their respective buckets. Incoming requests add water to the bucket, causing it to fill up. While the bucket is filled, water continues to leak out at a constant rate. If the request causes the bucket to overflow, the requests are discarded, ensuring that the request rate is controlled.\n\n## Challenges and Solutions\n\n1. **Latency**: Minimized by placing caches close to all components, and using efficient data structures.\n   \n2. **Consistency**: Distributed cache (using CAS or other mechanisms) ensures consistency across different instances.\n\n3. **Fault Tolerance**: Utilize redundancy, load balancing, and automatic failover mechanisms. Regular backups of persistent storage are also recommended.\n\n4. **Complexity**: Define clear interfaces between the components and use well-known design patterns and principles where possible. Thorough functional and performance testing is critical.\n\n5. **Scale with Load**: Implement aggressive caching and horizontal scaling. Ensure that the distributed caching layer can scale linearly with load.\n\n## Scalability Considerations\n\n- **Horizontal Scaling**:\n  - Increase the number of Rate Limiting Service instances.\n  - Increase the number of API Gateways.\n  - Distribute API Gateways geographically close to clients for low latency.\n\n- **Load Balancing**:\n  - Use DNS-based load balancing for routing clients to API Gateways.\n  - Use round robin, IP-based, or any other load balancing strategies depending on the application requirements to distribute requests among the Rate Limiting Services.\n\n- **Recovery and Rollback**:\n  - Monitor the health and performance of the Rate Limiting Services and API Gateways.\n  - Automatically adjust the number of instances and routing strategies based on the load.\n  - If issues are detected, rollback to a previous stable state.\n\n## Concurrency\n\n- Concurrent requests are handled by the Rate Limiting Services. Each service supports concurrent operations with atomic increment/decrement operations on the token count.\n- Distributed cache is essential for maintaining consistency during concurrent operations.\n\n## Data Consistency Models\n\n- **CAUSAL CONSISTENCY**: Rate limiting needs eventual consistency where the response to a request may not reflect the most recent token state until all prior update transactions to the same bucket have been completed.\n- **FLEXIBILITY**: The system can be adjusted to be more strongly consistent if necessary, such as by using a stronger cache coherence protocol.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe design of a Distributed Rate Limiter involves an API Gateway, Rate Limiting Services, Distributed Cache and Persistent Storage, ensuring the system is scalable, fault-tolerant, and consistent. Rate limiting algorithms (`token bucket` and `leaky bucket`), among others, are used to enforce client request rates.\n\nThis architecture provides a solid foundation for a rate limiting system that can handle high traffic and scale as necessary. \n\n---\n\n*Note: In a real-world scenario, specific technologies would be selected based on the use case's requirements (e.g., Redis, Consul, Kafka, etc.). This design provides a high-level overview of the principles involved.*",

    "response": "# Median Finder Data Structure\n\n## Problem Statement\nGiven a stream of integers, design a data structure that can efficiently find the median at any point. The median is the middle value in an ordered integer list. If the size of the list is even, there is no middle value, and the median is defined as the average of the two middle values.\n\n## Approach\nTo solve this problem efficiently, we can use two heaps: a max-heap and a min-heap. \n\n- **Max-Heap**: Will contain the smaller half of the numbers. We use a max-heap here, which in Python we can simulate by pushing the negative of the number since Python's `heapq` is a min-heap by default.\n  \n- **Min-Heap**: Will contain the larger half of the numbers.\n  \nThe idea is to maintain a balance between the number of elements in the two heaps. If the two heaps have the same number of elements, the median is the mean of the roots of the two heaps. If they do not, then the median is the root of the heap with more elements.\n\n### Operations\n- **Add**: When a new number is added, we need to maintain the heap property and balance between the heaps.\n- **Find Median**: The median is found based on the size of the heaps.\n\n## Implementation\n\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass MedianFinder:\n    def __init__(self):\n        \"\"\"\n        Initialize your data structure here.\n        \"\"\"\n        self.max_heap = []  # Max-heap (inverted min-heap)\n        self.min_heap = []  # Min-heap\n\n    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:\n        # Push new num to max-heap as negative to simulate max-heap\n        heapq.heappush(self.max_heap, -num)\n        \n        # Balance the heaps\n        # Move the largest element from max-heap to min-heap\n        max_heap_top = -heapq.heappop(self.max_heap)\n        heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, max_heap_top)\n        \n        # Ensure max-heap can have at most 1 more element than min-heap\n        if len(self.max_heap) < len(self.min_heap):\n            min_heap_top = heapq.heappop(self.min_heap)\n            heapq.heappush(self.max_heap, -min_heap_top)\n\n    def findMedian(self) -> float:\n        if len(self.max_heap) == len(self.min_heap):\n            # If both heaps are the same size, median is the average of the roots\n            return (-self.max_heap[0] + self.min_heap[0]) / 2\n        else:\n            # If max-heap has more elements, median is the root of max-heap\n            return -self.max_heap[0]\n```\n\n## Explanation of the Code\n- **Initialization**: We initialize two heaps: `max_heap` and `min_heap`.\n- **AddNum(num)**: \n  - First, we push the new number into the `max_heap`. Since Python\u2019s `heapq` only supports min-heaps, we store the negative of the numbers to simulate a max-heap.\n  - After pushing, we move the largest element from the `max_heap` to the `min_heap` to ensure the heaps maintain the properties.\n  - We then check if the `max_heap` has fewer elements than `min_heap`. If so, we move the smallest element from the `min_heap` back to the `max_heap` to maintain the balance.\n- **findMedian()**:\n  - If both heaps are of equal size, the median is the average of the roots of both heaps.\n  - If the sizes are unequal, the median is the root of the `max_heap`, since it can have at most 1 extra element.\n\nThis approach provides an `O(log n)` time complexity for adding a number and `O(1)` for finding the median, making it very efficient for streaming data.",
