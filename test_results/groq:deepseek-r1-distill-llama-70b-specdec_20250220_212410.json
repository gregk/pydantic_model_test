    "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to explain what a binary search tree is. Hmm, I remember that it's a type of data structure, but I'm a bit fuzzy on the details. Let me start by recalling what a tree is in general. A tree data structure has nodes, each node can have children, and there's a root node at the top. \n\nNow, a binary tree is a specific type where each node can have at most two children: a left child and a right child. That makes sense. But a binary search tree (BST) is more than just a binary tree. There must be some ordering involved. I think it has to do with how the nodes are arranged so that searching becomes efficient.\n\nWait, in a BST, for any given node, all the nodes in its left subtree have values less than the node's value, and all the nodes in the right subtree have greater values. Is that right? So if I have a node with value 5, everything to the left is less than 5, and everything to the right is greater than 5. That must help in searching because you can eliminate half the tree each time you make a comparison.\n\nI should also mention the properties of a BST. Let me list them: each node has a comparable value, left subtree contains nodes with smaller values, right subtree with larger values, and both subtrees are also BSTs. That seems correct.\n\nCommon operations in a BST would include insertion, deletion, and searching. Maybe I should explain each briefly. For insertion, you start at the root and compare the value to decide whether to go left or right until you find the correct spot. Deletion is trickier because if a node has two children, you need to find a replacement, like the smallest node in the right subtree. Searching is straightforward\u2014compare and navigate left or right accordingly.\n\nI should include an example to make it clearer. Maybe a simple tree with root 8, left child 3, right child 10, and so on. A code example would help too. I can write a basic Node class and a BST class with insert and inorder methods. That way, people can see how it's implemented.\n\nI wonder if I should mention the time complexity. Search, insertion, and deletion are O(h), where h is the height. In the average case, h is log n, so it's efficient. But in the worst case, like a skewed tree, it's O(n). Oh, right, that's why self-balancing BSTs like AVL or Red-Black trees are used to keep the tree balanced.\n\nWait, should I include advantages and disadvantages? It might be helpful. Advantages: efficient search, insertion, deletion; maintains data in order. Disadvantages: can become unbalanced, leading to poor performance.\n\nI think I've covered the main points. Now, I should structure this information clearly, using headers, bullet points, and code examples as requested. I'll start with an overview, then properties, operations, an example, time complexity, and maybe some pros and cons. Including a code snippet will make it practical.\n\nLet me make sure I'm not missing anything. Maybe a section on why BSTs are useful, like in databases or file systems for quick lookups. Also, perhaps a note on the difference between BST and other tree structures to clarify.\n\nI think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll organize the information step by step, ensuring each section flows logically into the next. I'll use clear headers and concise bullet points for readability. The code example should be simple enough to illustrate the concept without overwhelming the reader.\n</think>\n\n# Binary Search Tree (BST) Explanation\n\n## Overview\nA Binary Search Tree (BST) is a fundamental data structure that stores nodes in a hierarchical manner, facilitating efficient operations like search, insertion, and deletion. Each node contains a value, and the structure adheres to specific ordering rules.\n\n## Properties of a BST\n- **Comparable Values**: Each node holds a value that can be compared (e.g., integers, strings).\n- **Left Subtree Rule**: All nodes in the left subtree of a node have values less than the node's value.\n- **Right Subtree Rule**: All nodes in the right subtree of a node have values greater than the node's value.\n- **Subtree Structure**: Both left and right subtrees are themselves BSTs.\n\n## Common Operations in a BST\n- **Insertion**: Adds a new node in the correct position based on BST rules.\n- **Deletion**: Removes a node, handling cases where the node has 0, 1, or 2 children.\n- **Search**: Locates a specific value efficiently by navigating left or right based on comparisons.\n\n## Example of a BST\nConsider a BST with the root node 8:\n- Left child: 3\n  - Left child: 1\n  - Right child: 6\n- Right child: 10\n  - Right child: 14\n  - Left child: 4\n\nThis structure ensures that all left descendants of 8 are less than 8, and all right descendants are greater than 8.\n\n## Time Complexity\n- **Average Case**: Operations like search, insertion, and deletion run in O(log n) time due to the tree's height being logarithmic.\n- **Worst Case**: Can degrade to O(n) if the tree becomes skewed, resembling a linked list.\n\n## Advantages and Disadvantages\n- **Advantages**:\n  - Efficient average-case performance for key operations.\n  - Maintains data in a sorted order, which is useful for range queries.\n- **Disadvantages**:\n  - Performance can degrade without balancing, leading to worst-case behavior.\n  - Requires more complex management compared to arrays or linked lists.\n\n## Example Code Implementation\nHere's a basic implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\nclass BST:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = None\n\n    def insert(self, value):\n        if self.root is None:\n            self.root = Node(value)\n        else:\n            self._insert_recursive(self.root, value)\n\n    def _insert_recursive(self, node, value):\n        if value < node.value:\n            if node.left is None:\n                node.left = Node(value)\n            else:\n                self._insert_recursive(node.left, value)\n        else:\n            if node.right is None:\n                node.right = Node(value)\n            else:\n                self._insert_recursive(node.right, value)\n\n    def inorder_traversal(self):\n        self._inorder_traversal_recursive(self.root)\n\n    def _inorder_traversal_recursive(self, node):\n        if node:\n            self._inorder_traversal_recursive(node.left)\n            print(node.value)\n            self._inorder_traversal_recursive(node.right)\n\n# Example usage:\nbst = BST()\nbst.insert(8)\nbst.insert(3)\nbst.insert(10)\nbst.insert(1)\nbst.insert(6)\nbst.insert(4)\nbst.insert(14)\n\nprint(\"Inorder Traversal:\")\nbst.inorder_traversal()\n```\n\nThis code defines a `Node` class and a `BST` class with methods for insertion and inorder traversal, demonstrating how nodes are added and printed in ascending order.\n\n## Conclusion\nBSTs are versatile data structures offering efficient data management with average O(log n) performance for key operations. However, maintaining balance is crucial for optimal performance, often addressed using self-balancing variants like AVL trees or Red-Black trees.",

In Python, functions are defined using the 'def' keyword. So I'll start with something like 'def add_numbers(a, b):'.\n\nNext, the function needs to take two parameters, which are the numbers to be added. I'll name them 'a' and 'b' for simplicity.\n\nThen, inside the function, I'll return the sum of 'a' and 'b'. That's straightforward using the '+' operator.\n\nAfter writing the function, I should provide an example of how to use it. Maybe call the function with two numbers, like add_numbers(5, 3), which should return 8.\n\nI should also explain each part of the code so that someone new to Python can understand. I'll break it down into the function definition, parameters, the return statement, and the example usage.\n\nI'll format the explanation clearly, making sure each part is concise and easy to follow.

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to implement a Red-Black Tree insertion algorithm in Python. Let me start by recalling what a Red-Black Tree is. It's a self-balancing binary search tree with specific properties that ensure efficient operations. The main properties are that each node is either red or black, the root is black, all leaves are black, and if a node is red, both its children must be black. Also, every path from a node to its descendant leaves has the same number of black nodes.\n\nFirst, I'll need a Node class. Each node should have a value, pointers to left and right children, a parent pointer, and a color. I'll include type hints for these attributes. The color can be an enum, maybe using Literal from the typing module for better type checking.\n\nNext, the RedBlackTree class. It should have a root attribute, which is a Node or None. The insert method will take a value and add it to the tree. I'll need to handle the case where the tree is empty, in which case the new node becomes the root and is colored black.\n\nFor insertion, I'll start by creating a new node with value, color it red, and set its left and right children to None. Then, I'll use a loop to traverse the tree to find the correct position to insert the new node. I'll keep track of the current node and its parent. Once the correct spot is found, I'll set the parent's left or right child to the new node and update the new node's parent.\n\nAfter inserting, I'll call a helper method, _insert_fix, to fix the tree's properties if they were violated. This helper will handle cases where the insertion causes a red node to have a red child, which breaks the Red-Black Tree properties.\n\nIn _insert_fix, I'll check if the current node's parent is None, meaning it's the root, so I'll color it black. Otherwise, I'll check if the grandparent exists and if the parent and the current node are both red. If so, I'll restructure the tree. I'll consider the color of the uncle (the other child of the grandparent) to decide whether to rotate or recolor.\n\nThere are two main cases: when the uncle is red and when it's black. If the uncle is red, I'll color the parent and uncle black and make the grandparent red, then move up to the grandparent to continue checking. If the uncle is black, I'll check the orientation of the current node (left or right) relative to the parent and grandparent. Depending on that, I'll perform a left or right rotation and adjust the colors accordingly.\n\nI'll need to implement rotation methods, like _left_rotate and _right_rotate, which will handle the pointer adjustments during rotations. These methods will take a node and restructure the tree, returning the new root of the subtree.\n\nI should also include a method to print the tree in a readable format, maybe using a level order traversal. This will help in testing and debugging.\n\nThroughout the code, I'll add docstrings to explain each method's purpose and parameters. Type hints will be used to ensure clarity and help with static type checking.\n\nI'll test the implementation by inserting several values and checking if the tree maintains the Red-Black properties. For example, inserting 8, 18, 5, 15, 17, 25, 40, 60 and then checking the structure.\n\nPotential issues to watch out for include correctly handling edge cases, such as inserting into an empty tree, inserting at the beginning or end of the tree, and ensuring that rotations correctly update all necessary pointers and colors.\n\nI think that's a solid plan. Now, I'll proceed to write the code, making sure each part is correctly implemented and tested.\n</think>\n\nHere's an implementation of a Red-Black Tree in Python with type hints and docstrings:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Optional, Literal\n\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value: int):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left: Optional[Node] = None\n        self.right: Optional[Node] = None\n        self.parent: Optional[Node] = None\n        self.color: Literal['red', 'black'] = 'red'\n\nclass RedBlackTree:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root: Optional[Node] = None\n\n    def insert(self, value: int) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Insert a value into the Red-Black Tree.\"\"\"\n        node = Node(value)\n        if not self.root:\n            node.color = 'black'\n            self.root = node\n            return\n\n        current = self.root\n        while True:\n            parent = current\n            if node.value < current.value:\n                current = current.left\n                if not current:\n                    parent.left = node\n                    node.parent = parent\n                    break\n            else:\n                current = current.right\n                if not current:\n                    parent.right = node\n                    node.parent = parent\n                    break\n\n        self._insert_fix(node)\n\n    def _insert_fix(self, node: Node) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Fix the tree after insertion to maintain Red-Black properties.\"\"\"\n        while node.parent and node.parent.color == 'red':\n            grandparent = node.parent.parent\n            if not grandparent:\n                node.parent.color = 'black'\n                break\n\n            if node.parent == grandparent.left:\n                uncle = grandparent.right\n                if uncle and uncle.color == 'red':\n                    node.parent.color = 'black'\n                    uncle.color = 'black'\n                    grandparent.color = 'red'\n                    node = grandparent\n                else:\n                    if node == node.parent.right:\n                        node = node.parent\n                        self._left_rotate(node)\n                    node.parent.color = 'black'\n                    grandparent.color = 'red'\n                    self._right_rotate(grandparent)\n            else:\n                uncle = grandparent.left\n                if uncle and uncle.color == 'red':\n                    node.parent.color = 'black'\n                    uncle.color = 'black'\n                    grandparent.color = 'red'\n                    node = grandparent\n                else:\n                    if node == node.parent.left:\n                        node = node.parent\n                        self._right_rotate(node)\n                    node.parent.color = 'black'\n                    grandparent.color = 'red'\n                    self._left_rotate(grandparent)\n\n        self.root.color = 'black'\n\n    def _left_rotate(self, node: Node) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Rotate left around the given node.\"\"\"\n        pivot = node.right\n        node.right = pivot.left\n        if pivot.left:\n            pivot.left.parent = node\n        pivot.parent = node.parent\n        if not node.parent:\n            self.root = pivot\n        elif node == node.parent.left:\n            node.parent.left = pivot\n        else:\n            node.parent.right = pivot\n        pivot.left = node\n        node.parent = pivot\n\n    def _right_rotate(self, node: Node) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Rotate right around the given node.\"\"\"\n        pivot = node.left\n        node.left = pivot.right\n        if pivot.right:\n            pivot.right.parent = node\n        pivot.parent = node.parent\n        if not node.parent:\n            self.root = pivot\n        elif node == node.parent.right:\n            node.parent.right = pivot\n        else:\n            node.parent.left = pivot\n        pivot.right = node\n        node.parent = pivot\n\n    def print_tree(self, node: Optional[Node] = None, level: int = 0) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Print the tree using level order traversal.\"\"\"\n        if not node:\n            node = self.root\n        if node.right:\n            self.print_tree(node.right, level + 1)\n        print(' ' * 4 * level + '->', node.value, node.color)\n        if node.left:\n            self.print_tree(node.left, level + 1)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n\n1. **Node Class**:\n   -

`_insert_fix()`: Maintains the Red-Black properties after insertion.\n   - `_left_rotate()` and `_right_rotate()`: Helper methods for rotating nodes.\n\n3. **Insertion Process**:\n   - Creates a new node and places it in the tree.\n   - Calls `_insert_fix()` to ensure the tree maintains its properties.\n\n4. **Fixing the Tree**:\n   - Handles cases where the tree becomes unbalanced or violates color properties.\n   - Uses rotations and recoloring to maintain balance.\n\n5. **Rotation Methods**:\n   - `_left_rotate()` and `_right_rotate()` restructure the tree while maintaining the BST property.\n\n6. **Printing the Tree**:\n   - Uses level order traversal to print the tree structure.\n\n### Example Usage\n\n```python\nrb_tree = RedBlackTree()\nrb_tree.insert(8)\nrb_tree.insert(18)\nrb_tree.insert(5)\nrb_tree.insert(15)\nrb_tree.insert(17)\nrb_tree.insert(25)\nrb_tree.insert(40)\nrb_tree.insert(60)\n\nrb_tree.print_tree()\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that the Red-Black Tree properties are maintained after each insertion, providing efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations.",

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, I need to design a distributed rate limiter system. The user mentioned considering scalability, fault tolerance, and consistency. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, scalability. A distributed system should handle increasing traffic without performance degradation. I think using a distributed data store like Redis or etcd would help because they can scale horizontally. Also, a load balancer in front of the API endpoints makes sense to distribute incoming requests evenly.\n\nNext, fault tolerance. If one component fails, the system should keep running. Maybe using a circuit breaker pattern would prevent cascading failures. Also, having multiple instances of each component ensures redundancy. For the data store, replication is key so that data isn't lost if one node goes down.\n\nConsistency is tricky in a distributed system. I remember that eventually consistent systems are easier to scale but might have stale data. Strong consistency is better for accuracy but can be slower. Maybe using a strong consistency model with a consensus algorithm like Raft would be better for a rate limiter since accurate counts are crucial.\n\nFor the architecture, I'll need API endpoints that clients hit. These endpoints will check the rate limiter before processing requests. The rate limiter itself will interact with the distributed data store. A centralized configuration manager could handle the rate limits, ensuring all instances use the same rules.\n\nLet me sketch this out. The client sends a request to the load balancer, which directs it to an API endpoint. The endpoint checks the rate limiter, which queries the data store. If the limit isn't exceeded, the request is processed and the count is updated. If it is exceeded, an error is returned.\n\nI should also think about how the data store handles counters. Using atomic operations or transactions can prevent race conditions. Maybe each request increments a counter and checks against the limit in a single operation to avoid inconsistencies.\n\nTesting this system is important. I need to ensure that under high load, the rate limiter doesn't allow more requests than permitted. Also, if a data store instance fails, the system should recover without issues.\n\nI wonder if there are existing systems or algorithms that handle this well. The Token Bucket algorithm is popular for rate limiting. It allows for bursts and adapts to traffic. Implementing this in a distributed way could work, but synchronization might be a challenge.\n\nAnother consideration is the network latency. Since all components are distributed, ensuring low latency is crucial for performance. Maybe placing the data store close to the API endpoints or using a high-speed network can help.\n\nI should also document the configuration. Each rate limit rule needs to be manageable, so a configuration API would allow admins to adjust limits without downtime.\n\nPutting it all together, the system should have load balancers, multiple API instances, a distributed data store with replication, and a configuration manager. The rate limiter logic will use the Token Bucket algorithm, and the data store will handle the counters with strong consistency.\n\nI think that covers the main points. Now, I'll outline the architecture and explain each component's role in the design.\n</think>\n\n# Distributed Rate Limiter System Design\n\n## Overview\nThe goal of this design is to create a distributed rate limiter system that is scalable, fault-tolerant, and consistent. The system should be able to handle a large number of requests across multiple nodes while ensuring that the rate limits are enforced consistently.\n\n## Key Requirements\n1. **Scalability**: The system should be able to handle an increasing number of requests without degradation in performance.\n2. **Fault Tolerance**: The system should continue to function correctly even if one or more nodes fail.\n3. **Consistency**: The rate limits should be enforced consistently across all nodes in the system.\n\n## Architecture\n\n### Components\n1. **Load Balancer**\n   - Distributes incoming requests across multiple API endpoints.\n   - Ensures that no single node is overwhelmed with requests.\n\n2. **API Endpoints**\n   - These are the entry points for client requests.\n   - Each API endpoint will have a local cache to store rate limit counters.\n   - The local cache will be synchronized periodically with a centralized data store.\n\n3. **Distributed Data Store**\n   - Stores the global state of rate limit counters.\n   - Ensures consistency across all nodes.\n   - Supports atomic operations to prevent race conditions.\n\n4. **Rate Limiter**\n   - Implements the rate limiting logic.\n   - Uses the Token Bucket algorithm to enforce rate limits.\n   - Fetches the current count from the distributed data store, updates it, and checks if the rate limit has been exceeded.\n\n5. **Circuit Breaker**\n   - Detects when a node is failing and prevents further requests to it until it becomes healthy again.\n   - Ensures that the system remains responsive even if some nodes are down.\n\n### Data Flow\n1. **Client Request**\n   - The client sends a request to the load balancer.\n   - The load balancer directs the request to one of the API endpoints.\n\n2. **Rate Limit Check**\n   - The API endpoint checks the rate limiter to see if the client has exceeded their rate limit.\n   - The rate limiter fetches the current count from the distributed data store.\n\n3. **Update Count**\n   - If the rate limit has not been exceeded, the rate limiter updates the count in the distributed data store.\n   - The API endpoint processes the request and returns a response to the client.\n\n4. **Exceeded Rate Limit**\n   - If the rate limit has been exceeded, the rate limiter returns an error response to the client.\n\n### Distributed Data Store\nThe distributed data store is critical for ensuring consistency across all nodes. The store should support atomic operations to prevent race conditions when updating the rate limit counters.\n\n#### Options for Distributed Data Store\n1. **Redis**\n   - Redis is a popular in-memory data store that supports atomic operations.\n   - It has built-in support for counters and can be used with the Redisson library for distributed locks.\n\n2. **Etcd**\n   - Etcd is a distributed key-value store that provides strong consistency guarantees.\n   - It supports atomic operations and can be used to store and retrieve rate limit counters.\n\n3. **Zookeeper**\n   - Zookeeper is a coordination service that can be used to manage the distributed state of the system.\n   - It provides strong consistency guarantees and supports atomic operations.\n\n### Circuit Breaker\nThe circuit breaker pattern is used to detect when a node is failing and prevent further requests to it until it becomes healthy again. This ensures that the system remains responsive even if some nodes are down.\n\n#### Implementation\n1. **State**\n   - **Closed**: The circuit is closed, and requests are being sent to the node.\n   - **Open**: The circuit is open, and requests are not being sent to the node.\n   - **Half-Open**: The circuit is in a half-open state, and a probe request is sent to the node to check if it has recovered.\n\n2. **Threshold**\n   - If a certain threshold of requests fail, the circuit is opened, and requests are no longer sent to the node.\n\n3. **Probe**\n   - After a certain period of time, a probe request is sent to the node to check if it has recovered.\n   - If the probe request succeeds, the circuit is closed again, and requests are sent to the node.\n\n### Consistency Model\nThe system should use a strong consistency model to ensure that all nodes have the same view of the rate limit counters. This can be achieved using a consensus algorithm like Raft or Paxos.\n\n#### Raft Algorithm\n1. **Leader Election**\n   - The nodes elect a leader that is responsible for managing the distributed state.\n\n2. **Log Replication**\n   - The leader replicates the log to all followers.\n   - The log contains the history of updates to the rate limit counters.\n\n3. **Heartbeats**\n   - The leader sends heartbeats to the followers to maintain its leadership.\n   - If a follower does not receive a heartbeat within a certain period, it assumes the leader has failed and initiates a new leader election.\n\n### Fault Tolerance\n1. **Node Failure**\n   - If an API endpoint node fails, the load balancer detects it and stops sending requests to it.\n   - The circuit breaker ensures that requests are not sent to the failed node until it recovers.\n\n2. **Data Store Failure**\n   - The distributed data store should be replicated across multiple nodes to ensure that the data is not lost in case of a failure.\n   - The system should be able to recover from the failure of one or more data store nodes.\n\n### Scalability\n1. **Horizontal Scaling**\n   - The system should be able to scale horizontally by adding more API endpoint nodes as needed.\n   - The load balancer should be able to distribute requests across all available nodes.\n\n2. **Sharding**\n   - The rate limit counters can be sharded across multiple data store nodes to improve performance.\n   - Each shard can be responsible for a subset of the rate limit counters.\n\n### Token Bucket Algorithm\nThe Token Bucket algorithm is used to enforce rate limits. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Token Generation**\n   - Tokens are generated at a constant rate.\n   - The rate at which tokens are generated corresponds to the rate limit.\n\n2. **Token Consumption**\n   - Each request consumes a token.\n   - If there are no tokens available, the request is blocked.\n\n3. **Burst Capacity**\n   - The token bucket can hold a certain number of tokens, which allows for burst traffic.\n\n### Example Use Case\nSuppose we want to enforce a rate limit of 100 requests per second with a burst capacity of 10 requests.\n\n1. **Token Generation**\n   - Tokens are generated at a rate of 100 per second.\n\n2. **Token Consumption**\n   - Each request consumes one token.\n\n3. **Burst Capacity**\n   - The token bucket can hold up to 10 tokens, allowing for a burst of 10 requests in a short period.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe distributed rate limiter system designed here is scalable, fault-tolerant, and consistent. It uses a distributed data store to ensure consistency, a circuit breaker to handle node failures, and the Token Bucket algorithm to enforce rate limits. The system can be scaled horizontally by adding more API endpoint nodes and sharding the rate limit counters across multiple data store nodes.\n\n```plaintext\n                      +---------------+\n                      |  Load      |\n                      |  Balancer  |\n                      +---------------+\n                             |\n                             |\n                             v\n                     +------------------+\n                     |  API Endpoint  |\n                     |  (Rate Limiter) |\n                     +------------------+\n                             |\n                             |\n                             v\n                     +------------------+\n                     | Distributed    |\n                     |  Data Store    |\n                     +------------------+\n                             |\n                             |\n                             v\n                     +------------------+\n                     |  Circuit       |\n                     |  Breaker        |\n                     +------------------+\n```\n\nThis architecture ensures that the system can handle a large number of requests while enforcing rate limits consistently across all nodes.

    "response": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to design a data structure that can efficiently find the median of a stream of integers. Hmm, the median is the middle value when the numbers are sorted. If there's an even number of elements, it's the average of the two middle ones. But calculating this on the fly as numbers come in could be tricky.\n\nWait, if I just store all the numbers in a list and sort it every time I add a new number, that would work, but sorting each time is O(n log n), which isn't efficient for large streams. I need something better.\n\nOh right, I remember something about using two heaps: a max-heap for the lower half and a min-heap for the upper half. That way, the top of the heaps can give me the median. Let me think about how that works.\n\nSo, the max-heap will hold the smaller half of the numbers, and the min-heap will hold the larger half. The top of the max-heap would be the median if the total number of elements is odd. If it's even, I can average the tops of both heaps.\n\nBut how do I maintain the balance between the two heaps? I guess after adding a number, I might need to rebalance them so that their sizes differ by at most one. For example, if I add a number to the max-heap, I should check if the top of the max-heap is larger than the top of the min-heap and adjust accordingly.\n\nWait, actually, when inserting a new number, I should first add it to one of the heaps and then balance. Let me outline the steps:\n\n1. Add the new number to the appropriate heap. If it's smaller than the max-heap's top, it goes to the max-heap; else, to the min-heap.\n2. Then, check the sizes of both heaps. If one is more than one larger than the other, extract the top and add it to the other heap.\n3. This ensures that the heaps are balanced, maintaining the property for median calculation.\n\nIn Python, the heapq module only implements a min-heap. So to create a max-heap, I can invert the values by storing negatives. That way, the smallest negative (which is the largest original number) will be at the top.\n\nLet me sketch some code. I'll have two heaps: lower (max-heap) and higher (min-heap). For each new number:\n\n- If the number is less than or equal to the top of the lower heap (remembering it's stored as negative), add it to the lower heap.\n- Else, add it to the higher heap.\n- Then, balance the heaps so that the size difference is at most one.\n\nWait, but after adding, I might need to check if the heaps are balanced. For example, if the lower heap has two more elements than the higher, I need to move the top of the lower to the higher.\n\nAlso, when getting the median, if the total count is odd, it's the top of the lower heap (as a negative). If even, average the tops of both heaps.\n\nTesting this logic with some examples would help. Let's say the stream is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.\n\n- After 1: lower has 1, higher is empty. Median is 1.\n- After 2: lower has 1 and 2. Higher is empty. Wait, no, since 2 is larger than 1, it should go to higher. So lower has 1, higher has 2. Now, lower has size 1, higher size 1. Median is (1+2)/2 = 1.5.\n- After 3: Compare 3 with lower's top (1). 3 is larger, so add to higher. Now lower has 1, higher has 2,3. So sizes are 1 and 2. Need to balance by moving 2 from higher to lower. Now lower has 1,2 and higher has 3. Median is 2.\n- After 4: Compare with lower's top (2). 4>2, add to higher. Now lower has 2 elements, higher has 2. So sizes are equal. Median is (2+3)/2 = 2.5.\n- After 5: Add to higher. Now higher has 3,4,5. Lower has 2. So sizes are 2 and 3. Need to move 3 from higher to lower. Now lower has 2,3 and higher has 4,5. Median is 3.\n\nThat seems to work. So the logic holds.\n\nNow, implementing this in Python. I'll create a class with methods to add numbers and get the median.\n\nI need to handle the case when both heaps are empty, but the problem says it's a stream, so maybe the first number is handled correctly.\n\nWait, in the initial state, both heaps are empty. When the first number comes in, it's added to the lower heap. Then, since the heaps are empty, it's the median.\n\nI think that's covered.\n\nSo, the code will have:\n\n- Two heaps, lower (max-heap using negatives) and higher (min-heap).\n- An insert method that adds the number to the appropriate heap and balances.\n- A get_median method that checks the sizes and returns the median accordingly.\n\nI should also keep track of the sizes, perhaps with variables, or just use the lengths of the heaps.\n\nTesting the code with the example I did earlier should show correct medians.\n\nI think that's a solid approach. Now, writing the code accordingly.\n</think>\n\nTo efficiently find the median of a stream of integers, we can use a data structure that maintains two heaps: a max-heap for the lower half of the numbers and a min-heap for the upper half. This approach ensures that we can quickly compute the median at any point in O(1) time after each insertion, which occurs in O(log n) time.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Data Structures**: Use two heaps:\n   - A max-heap (`lower`) to store the lower half of the numbers.\n   - A min-heap (`higher`) to store the upper half of the numbers.\n   \n2. **Insertion**:\n   - For each new number, add it to the appropriate heap:\n     - If the number is less than or equal to the maximum of the lower heap, add it to `lower`.\n     - Otherwise, add it to `higher`.\n   - Balance the heaps to ensure the size difference between them is at most one. If `lower` has more than one element than `higher`, move the maximum element from `lower` to `higher`, and vice versa.\n\n3. **Median Calculation**:\n   - If the total number of elements is odd, the median is the maximum element of the lower heap.\n   - If even, the median is the average of the maximum of the lower heap and the minimum of the upper heap.\n\n### Solution Code\n```python\nimport heapq\n\nclass MedianFinder:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # lower is a max-heap implemented using negative values\n        self.lower = []\n        # higher is a min-heap\n        self.higher = []\n\n    def add_num(self, num: int) -> None:\n        if not self.lower or num <= -self.lower[0]:\n            heapq.heappush(self.lower, -num)\n        else:\n            heapq.heappush(self.higher, num)\n        \n        # Balance the heaps\n        if len(self.lower) > len(self.higher) + 1:\n            # Move the largest from lower to higher\n            val = -heapq.heappop(self.lower)\n            heapq.heappush(self.higher, val)\n        elif len(self.higher) > len(self.lower):\n            # Move the smallest from higher to lower\n            val = heapq.heappop(self.higher)\n            heapq.heappush(self.lower, -val)\n\n    def find_median(self) -> float:\n        total = len(self.lower) + len(self.higher)\n        if total == 0:\n            return None  # or raise an error if empty stream is not expected\n        \n        if total % 2 == 1:\n            return -self.lower[0]\n        else:\n            return (-self.lower[0] + self.higher[0]) / 2.0\n\n# Example usage:\nmf = MedianFinder()\nmf.add_num(1)\nprint(mf.find_median())  # Output: 1\nmf.add_num(2)\nprint(mf.find_median())  # Output: 1.5\nmf.add_num(3)\nprint(mf.find_median())  # Output: 2\nmf.add_num(4)\nprint(mf.find_median())  # Output: 2.5\nmf.add_num(5)\nprint(mf.find_median())  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- **Initialization**: The `MedianFinder` class initializes two heaps, `lower` (max-heap) and `higher` (min-heap).\n- **Insertion (`add_num`)**: Each number is added to the appropriate heap based on its value relative to the current maximum of the lower heap. The heaps are then balanced to maintain the size constraint.\n- **Median Calculation (`find_median`)**: Depending on whether the total number of elements is odd or even, the median is computed from the tops of the heaps.\n\nThis approach ensures efficient insertion and median calculation, making it suitable for handling a stream of integers.",
