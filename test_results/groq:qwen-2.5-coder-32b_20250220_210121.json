Here's how you would show the work for 2+2 in markdown format:\n\n```\n2 + 2 = 4\n```\n\nWhile markdown doesn't inherently support step-by-step calculations or complex formatting for showing work in math problems, you can still display the equation and the result like above. If you wanted to make it a bit more visually appealing or to break it down into steps (which is a bit redundant for such a simple calculation), you could do something like this:\n\n```\nStep 1: Start with the numbers 2 and 2\nStep 2: Add them together\n        2 + 2\nStep 3: Calculate the sum\n        4\n```\n\nThis format is more useful for more complex problems where showing each step is important. For a simple addition like 2+2, the first method is usually sufficient.",

    "response": "# Binary Search Tree (BST)\n\nA **Binary Search Tree** is a node-based binary tree data structure that has the following properties:\n\n- Each node has at most two children, referred to as the **left child** and **right child**.\n- For each node, the values of all the nodes in the left subtree are **smaller** than the node's value.\n- For each node, the values of all the nodes in the right subtree are **greater** than the node's value.\n- This property must hold true for all nodes in the tree.\n\n## Structure of a Binary Search Tree\n\nA BST can be visualized as follows:\n\n```\n      50\n     /  \\\n   30   70\n  / \\   / \\\n20  40 60  80\n```\n\nIn this example:\n- The root node is `50`.\n- The left child of `50` is `30` and its right child is `70`.\n- `30`'s left child is `20` and its right child is `40`.\n- `70`'s left child is `60` and its right child is `80`.\n\n## Basic Operations\n\n### Insertion\n\nTo insert a new element in the BST:\n\n1. Start at the root node.\n2. If the tree is empty, the new element becomes the root.\n3. Otherwise, recursively find the correct position to insert the new element:\n   - If the element is less than the current node, move to the left child.\n   - If the element is greater than the current node, move to the right child.\n4. Insert the new element at the position that is reached.\n\n**Example of inserting a node:**\n\n```plaintext\nInsert 65:\n      50\n     /  \\\n   30   70\n  / \\   / \\\n20  40 60  80\n         \\\n         65\n```\n\n### Deletion\n\nTo delete a node from the BST:\n\n1. Find the node to be deleted.\n2. Once the node is found, there can be three cases:\n   - The node to delete has no children (end node): simply delete the node.\n   - The node to delete has one child: remove the node and replace it with its child.\n   - The node to delete has two children: find the node's in-order successor or predecessor, swap values, and then delete the node.\n3. Adjust the pointers accordingly to maintain the tree structure.\n\n**Example of deleting a node:**\n\n```plaintext\nDelete 30:\n      50\n     /  \\\n   40   70\n  /      / \\\n20     60  80\n         \\\n         65\n```\n\n### Search\n\nTo search for a value in the BST:\n\n1. Start at the root.\n2. Compare the desired value with the node's value:\n   - If they are equal, the value is found.\n   - If the desired value is smaller, move to the left child.\n   - If the desired value is larger, move to the right child.\n3. Repeat step 2 until the value is found or the subtree is empty (indicating the value is not in the tree).\n\n**Example of searching for a value:**\n\n```plaintext\nSearch for 65:\n      50\n     /  \\\n   40   70\n  /      / \\\n20     60  80\n         \\\n         65  <-- 65 is found\n```\n\n## Advantages\n\n- The BST provides efficient lookup, insertion, and deletion operations, each with a time complexity of `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree.\n- In a balanced BST, the height is `O(log n)`, making the operations very efficient.\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n- The efficiency of operations depends on the height of the tree, which can become `O(n)` if the tree becomes unbalanced (e.g., like a linked list).\n\n## Balanced Binary Search Trees\n\nTo maintain the efficiency of BST operations, there are variants of BST that keep the tree balanced:\n\n- **Avl Tree**\n- **Red-Black Tree**\n\nThese trees have additional properties and rules for rotations to ensure the tree remains balanced after insertions and deletions.\n\n## Code Example (Insertion in a BST)\n\nHere is a simple Python code to insert a new value in a BST:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, key):\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n        self.val = key\n\ndef insert(root, key):\n    if root is None:\n        return Node(key)\n    else:\n        if root.val < key:\n            root.right = insert(root.right, key)\n        else:\n            root.left = insert(root.left, key)\n    return root\n```\n\nThis code defines a `Node` class and a function `insert` to add a new key to the BST.",
