    "response": "# Binary Search Tree (BST)\n\nA Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based data structure used in computer science for storing data in a hierarchical manner. It facilitates fast lookup, addition, and removal of items. The key properties of a BST are:\n\n- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node\u2019s key.\n- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node\u2019s key.\n- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.\n\n## Structure\n\nA binary search tree consists of nodes, where each node has:\n- A data element.\n- A reference to the left child node.\n- A reference to the right child node.\n\n## Operations\n\n### Insertion\n\nTo insert a new node into a BST, compare the node's key with the root's key. If the new key is less than the root's key, the node is inserted into the left subtree. Otherwise, it is inserted into the right subtree. This process is repeated until an appropriate empty spot is found.\n\n#### Example Code for Insertion\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, key):\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n        self.val = key\n\ndef insert(root, key):\n    if root is None:\n        return Node(key)\n    else:\n        if root.val < key:\n            root.right = insert(root.right, key)\n        else:\n            root.left = insert(root.left, key)\n    return root\n```\n\n### Traversal\n\nIn-order traversal of a BST visits nodes in the ascending order of their value. Post-order and pre-order traversals can also be performed but do not guarantee sorted order.\n\n#### Example Code for In-order Traversal\n\n```python\ndef inorder_traversal(root):\n    if root:\n        inorder_traversal(root.left)\n        print(root.val)\n        inorder_traversal(root.right)\n```\n\n### Deletion\n\nTo delete a node in a BST requires handling three different cases:\n- Node to be deleted is the leaf: Simply remove from the tree.\n- Node to be deleted has only one child: Remove the node and link its parent directly to its child.\n- Node to be deleted has two children: Find its in-order successor (smallest in right subtree), copy contents of the in-order successor to the node and delete the in-order successor.\n\n#### Example Code for Deletion\n\n```python\ndef delete_node(root, key):\n    # Base case: Root is None\n    if root is None:\n        return root\n\n    # Recursive cases for left or right subtrees\n    if key < root.val:\n        root.left = delete_node(root.left, key)\n    elif key > root.val:\n        root.right = delete_node(root.right, key)\n    else:\n        # Node with only one child or no child\n        if root.left is None:\n            temp = root.right\n            root = None\n            return temp\n        elif root.right is None:\n            temp = root.left\n            root = None\n            return temp\n\n        # Node with two children: Get the inorder successor\n        temp = min_value_node(root.right)\n\n        # Copy the inorder successor's content to this node\n        root.val = temp.val\n\n        # Delete the inorder successor\n        root.right = delete_node(root.right, temp.val)\n\n    return root\n\ndef min_value_node(node):\n    current = node\n    # Loop down to find the leftmost leaf\n    while(current.left is not None):\n        current = current.left\n    return current\n```\n\n### Searching\n\nTo search for a key in a BST, compare the search key with the root\u2019s key. If the search key matches the root\u2019s key, the node is found. If the search key is less than the root's key, the search continues in the left subtree. If the search key is greater, the search continues in the right subtree. This process is repeated until the key is found or the sub-tree becomes empty.\n\n#### Example Code for Searching\n\n```python\ndef search(root, key):\n    # Base Cases: root is null or key is present at root\n    if root is None or root.val == key:\n        return root\n\n    # Key is greater than root's key\n    if root.val < key:\n        return search(root.right, key)\n\n    # Key is smaller than root's key\n    return search(root.left, key)\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBinary Search Trees are a fundamental data structure used for implementing efficient dynamic sets. They provide a way to store elements in a form that allows for fast lookups, additions, and removals. However, the efficiency of BST operations depends on the height of the tree, which can vary from \\(O(\\log n)\\) in a balanced tree to \\(O(n)\\) in a skewed tree. Balancing techniques like AVL and Red-Black Trees can be used to maintain efficiency.",

Type hints are provided to specify the expected types of inputs and the output.\n\n## Function Definition\n- **Name**: `add_numbers`\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `a`: The first number (either `int` or `float`).\n  - `b`: The second number (either `int` or `float`).\n- **Returns**: The sum of `a` and `b` (will be `float` if any number is `float`, otherwise `int`).\n\n## Example Usage\n```python\nresult = add_numbers(3, 5)\nprint(result)  # Output: 8\n\nresult = add_numbers(2.5, 3.5)\nprint(result)  # Output: 6.0\n```\n\n## Code Implementation\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Add two numbers and return the sum.\n\n    Parameters:\n    a (float): The first number to add.\n    b (float): The second number to add.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The sum of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n```\n\nThe function is straightforward, utilizing Python's dynamic typing capabilities to handle both `int` and `float` inputs seamlessly. The type hint `float` is used for simplicity, but it could be refined to accept both types if needed.\n```",
