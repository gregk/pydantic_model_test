    "response": "# Binary Search Tree (BST)\n\nA Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:\n- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node\u2019s key.\n- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node\u2019s key.\n- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.\n\n## Structure of a BST\n- **Node**: Each node in a BST contains data (often a key), a pointer/reference to the left child node, and a pointer/reference to the right child node.\n- **Root**: The topmost node in the tree.\n- **Leaf**: Nodes that do not have child nodes.\n\n## Basic Operations\n- **Insertion**: A new node is added to the BST. This involves finding the correct position for the node.\n- **Search**: Finding a node with a specific value is done by traversing the tree, comparing the search value to each node's value.\n- **Deletion**: Removing a node from the BST can be slightly complex due to the need to maintain the BST properties post-deletion.\n\n## Advantages\n- Efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations with an average time complexity of O(log n).\n- The order of elements is maintained, which makes the tree useful for dynamic data retrieval.\n\n## Disadvantages\n- Worst-case time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations can be O(n) if the tree becomes unbalanced (like a linked list).\n\n## Example Code\n\nHere is a simple implementation of a Binary Search Tree in Python with insert, search, and in-order traversal methods.\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, key):\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n        self.val = key\n\ndef insert(root, key):\n    \"\"\" A utility function to insert a new node with the given key in BST \"\"\"\n    # If the tree is empty, return a new node\n    if root is None:\n        return Node(key)\n    \n    # Otherwise, recur down the tree\n    if key < root.val:\n        root.left = insert(root.left, key)\n    else:\n        root.right = insert(root.right, key)\n    \n    # return the (unchanged) node pointer\n    return root\n\ndef search(root, key):\n    \"\"\" A utility function to search a given key in BST \"\"\"\n    # Base Cases: root is null or key is present at root\n    if root is None or root.val == key:\n        return root\n    \n    # Key is greater than root's key\n    if root.val < key:\n        return search(root.right, key)\n    \n    # Key is smaller than root's key\n    return search(root.left, key)\n\ndef inorder_traversal(root):\n    \"\"\" A utility function to do inorder tree traversal \"\"\"\n    res = []\n    if root:\n        res = inorder_traversal(root.left)\n        res.append(root.val)\n        res = res + inorder_traversal(root.right)\n    return res\n\n# Example usage:\nr = Node(50)\nr = insert(r, 30)\nr = insert(r, 20)\nr = insert(r, 40)\nr = insert(r, 70)\nr = insert(r, 60)\nr = insert(r, 80)\n\n# Print in-order traversal of the BST\nprint(\"Inorder traversal of the given tree\")\nprint(inorder_traversal(r))\n\n# Search for a key in the BST\nkey = 40\nif search(r, key):\n    print(f\"Key {key} found in the BST\")\nelse:\n    print(f\"Key {key} not found in the BST\")\n```\n\n## Explanation of the Code\n- **Node Class**: Represents each node in the tree.\n- **Insert Function**: Inserts a new node in the BST.\n- **Search Function**: Searches a node with a given key in the BST.\n- **Inorder Traversal**: Traverses the tree in an in-order fashion (left subtree, root, right subtree), and returns the nodes' keys in sorted order.\n\nThis example demonstrates the basic mechanics of a binary search tree, showing how to insert keys, search for a key, and traverse the tree using inorder traversal.",

Below is a simple Python function that adds two numbers, formatted in markdown with explanations and including type hints and a docstring.\n\n```markdown\n# Function to Add Two Numbers\n\nThis Python function `add_numbers` takes two numerical arguments and returns their sum. Type hints are used to specify that the inputs should be of type `float` or `int`, and the return type will also be a `float` or `int`. This helps in ensuring that the function is used correctly and aids in readability and maintenance of the code.\n\nA docstring is also provided to describe what the function does, its parameters, and its return value. This is helpful for anyone reading or using the function to understand its purpose easily.\n\n## Code\n```python\ndef add_numbers(a: float, b: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Adds two numbers and returns the sum.\n\n    Parameters:\n    a (float): The first number to add.\n    b (float): The second number to add.\n\n    Returns:\n    float: The sum of the two numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    return a + b\n```\n\n## Example Usage\n```python\nresult = add_numbers(3, 5)\nprint(result)  # Output: 8\n```\n\nIn this example, `add_numbers` is called with the integers `3` and `5`, and it correctly returns the sum `8`. The function can also handle floating-point numbers seamlessly.\n```\n\n```markdown\nThis completes the explanation and the example of the `add_numbers` function in Python.\n```",
