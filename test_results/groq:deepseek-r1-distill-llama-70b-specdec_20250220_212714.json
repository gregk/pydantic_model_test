Let me break down what they asked for.\n\nFirst, they want an abstract interface defining basic operations. So, I should create an abstract base class with methods like get, set, delete, and exists. Using abc module makes sense here. I'll also include type hints for clarity and docstrings for documentation.\n\nNext, a local file-based implementation. I'll need to use JSON to serialize data. The data will be stored in a file, so I'll have to handle reading and writing. I should think about where to store this file\u2014maybe a default directory like .kvstore. I'll need to handle exceptions, like when the directory doesn't exist, so I'll create it if it's missing. Also, I'll use thread locks to prevent race conditions when accessing the file.\n\nThen, a Redis implementation. I'll use the redis-py library. This should be simpler since Redis handles concurrency better. I'll set up a connection pool and implement the same interface methods. I'll need to handle connection errors and ensure proper disconnection with a context manager.\n\nI should structure the code into separate files as specified. Each implementation will import the interface and implement the abstract methods. Proper error handling is crucial, so I'll include try-except blocks and raise custom exceptions for things like connection issues or missing keys.\n\nFinally, I'll format the response with markdown, showing each file in a code block with a brief explanation. I'll make sure to include type hints, docstrings, and example usages where applicable.\n\nI think that covers all the requirements. Now, I'll write each file step by step, ensuring everything is properly implemented and documented.\n</think>\n\nHere's a Python implementation of a key-value store with the specified requirements:\n\n### src/store/interfaces/key_value_store.py\n```python\nfrom abc import ABC, abstractmethod\nfrom typing import Any, Optional\n\nclass KeyValueStore(ABC):\n    \"\"\"Abstract interface for a key-value store.\"\"\"\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def get(self, key: str) -> Optional[Any]:\n        \"\"\"Retrieve the value associated with the given key.\n        \n        Args:\n            key: The key to look up.\n            \n        Returns:\n            The value associated with the key, or None if the key does not exist.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def set(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Set the value associated with the given key.\n        \n        Args:\n            key: The key to set.\n            value: The value to associate with the key.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def delete(self, key: str) -> None:\n        \"\"\"Remove the key-value pair associated with the given key.\n        \n        Args:\n            key: The key to delete.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n    \n    @abstractmethod\n    def exists(self, key: str) -> bool:\n        \"\"\"Check if the given key exists in the store.\n        \n        Args:\n            key: The key to check.\n            \n        Returns:\n            True if the key exists, False otherwise.\n        \"\"\"\n        pass\n```\n\n### src/store/implementations/local_store.py\n```python\nimport json\nimport os\nimport threading\nfrom typing import Any, Optional\nfrom ..interfaces.key_value_store import KeyValueStore\n\nclass LocalStore(KeyValueStore):\n    \"\"\"Local file-based key-value store implementation.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, storage_path: str = \"~/.kvstore\"):\n        \"\"\"Initialize the local store with a storage path.\n        \n        Args:\n            storage_path: Path to store the data.

The local store is suitable for development and small-scale use cases, while the Redis store is better for distributed and high-performance scenarios.",
