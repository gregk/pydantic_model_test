    "response": "# Binary Search Tree (BST)\n\n## Definition\nA Binary Search Tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node contains a value and has up to two children (left and right). The tree follows specific ordering rules that make searching efficient.\n\n## Key Properties\n* Each node has at most two children\n* Left child contains a value less than the parent\n* Right child contains a value greater than the parent\n* All nodes in the left subtree are less than the parent\n* All nodes in the right subtree are greater than the parent\n\n## Basic Structure\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n```\n\n## Common Operations\n\n### 1. Insertion\n* Compare the new value with the root\n* If smaller, go to left subtree\n* If larger, go to right subtree\n* Repeat until finding an empty spot\n\n```python\ndef insert(root, value):\n    if root is None:\n        return Node(value)\n    \n    if value < root.value:\n        root.left = insert(root.left, value)\n    else:\n        root.right = insert(root.right, value)\n    \n    return root\n```\n\n### 2. Search\n* Start at the root\n* If target is less than current node, go left\n* If target is greater than current node, go right\n* Continue until found or reach null\n\n```python\ndef search(root, target):\n    if root is None or root.value == target:\n        return root\n    \n    if target < root.value:\n        return search(root.left, target)\n    return search(root.right, target)\n```\n\n## Time Complexity\n* Average case: O(log n) for search, insert, and delete\n* Worst case: O(n) if tree becomes unbalanced\n* Best case: O(log n) when tree is balanced\n\n## Use Cases\n* Implementing dictionaries\n* Database indexing\n* File system organization\n* Symbol tables in compilers\n\n## Advantages\n* Efficient searching\n* Maintains sorted data\n* Flexible for dynamic data\n* Supports range queries\n\n## Disadvantages\n* Can become unbalanced\n* No constant-time operations\n* Requires additional memory for pointers\n\nRemember that Binary Search Trees are the foundation for more advanced tree structures like AVL trees and Red-Black trees, which maintain balance automatically.",
