    "response": "# Binary Search Tree (BST)\n\nA Binary Search Tree (BST) is a data structure that facilitates fast lookup, addition, and removal of items. It is a node-based binary tree data structure which has the following properties:\n\n- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node\u2019s key.\n- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node\u2019s key.\n- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.\n- There must be no duplicate nodes.\n\n## Structure of a Node\n\nEach node in a Binary Search Tree contains the following parts:\n- data: The value stored in the node.\n- left: A pointer to the left child node or `null` if there is no left child.\n- right: A pointer to the right child node or `null` if there is no right child.\n\n## Operations on BST\n\n1. **Insertion**\n2. **Search**\n3. **Deletion**\n\n### Insertion\n\nTo insert a new node with a given key, you compare the key with the root key and decide whether to go left or right. This process repeats recursively until you find an empty spot.\n\n#### Example Code for Insertion\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, key):\n        self.data = key\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\ndef insert(root, key):\n    # If the tree is empty, return a new node\n    if root is None:\n        return Node(key)\n\n    # Otherwise, recur down the tree\n    if key < root.data:\n        root.left = insert(root.left, key)\n    else:\n        root.right = insert(root.right, key)\n\n    # return the (unchanged) node pointer\n    return root\n```\n\n### Search\n\nSearching a key in a Binary Search Tree involves comparing the key with the root node of the tree or sub-tree. If the key is less, then we go to the left sub-tree. If the key is greater, then we go to the right sub-tree. And if the key is equal to the root node, then the node is found.\n\n#### Example Code for Searching\n\n```python\ndef search(root, key):\n    # Base Cases: root is null or key is present at root\n    if root is None or root.data == key:\n        return root\n\n    # Key is greater than root's key\n    if root.data < key:\n        return search(root.right, key)\n\n    # Key is smaller than root's key\n    return search(root.left, key)\n```\n\n### Deletion\n\nDeleting a node in a BST can be complex due to the requirement to maintain the properties of a BST. There are several cases:\n1. Node to be deleted is leaf: Simply remove from the tree.\n2. Node to be deleted has only one child: Remove the node and replace it with its child.\n3. Node to be deleted has two children: Find the node's inorder successor (smallest in the right subtree) or predecessor (largest in the left subtree), swap values with the node and delete the successor or predecessor.\n\n#### Example Code for Deletion\n\n```python\ndef minValueNode(node):\n    current = node\n\n    # loop down to find the leftmost leaf\n    while(current.left is not None):\n        current = current.left\n\n    return current\n\ndef deleteNode(root, key):\n    # Base Case\n    if root is None:\n        return root \n\n    # If the key to be deleted is smaller than the root's\n    # key then it lies in  left subtree\n    if key < root.data:\n        root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key)\n\n    # If the key to be deleted is greater than the root's key\n    # then it lies in right subtree\n    elif(key > root.data):\n        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key)\n\n    # If key is same as root's key, then this is the node\n    # to be deleted\n    else:\n        # Node with only one child or no child\n        if root.left is None:\n            temp = root.right\n            root = None\n            return temp \n\n        elif root.right is None:\n            temp = root.left\n            root = None\n            return temp\n\n        # Node with two children: Get the inorder successor\n        # (smallest in the right subtree)\n        temp = minValueNode(root.right)\n\n        # Copy the inorder successor's content to this node\n        root.data = temp.data\n\n        # Delete the inorder successor\n        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, temp.data)\n\n    return root\n```\n\n## Advantages\n\n- Average time complexity for search, insert, and delete operations is \\(O(\\log n)\\).\n- Can be used to implement map and multimap.\n- Can be converted into a sorted array.\n\n## Disadvantages\n\n- Worst-case time complexity for search, insert, and delete is \\(O(n)\\) (when the tree is unbalanced and becomes a linked list).\n- Not flexible in adjusting its height automatically; it requires additional work to maintain its balance.\n\n### Balanced Binary Search Tree\n\nTo overcome the disadvantages of the BST, self-balancing versions like AVL trees and Red-Black trees were created. These trees maintain balance, ensuring that operations take logarithmic time in the worst case.",
