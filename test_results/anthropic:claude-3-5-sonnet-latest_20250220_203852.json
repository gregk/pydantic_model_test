    "response": "# Binary Search Tree (BST)\n\n## Definition\nA Binary Search Tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node contains a value and has up to two children (left and right). The tree follows specific ordering rules that make searching efficient.\n\n## Key Properties\n* Every node has at most two children\n* Left subtree contains only nodes with values less than the parent node\n* Right subtree contains only nodes with values greater than the parent node\n* No duplicate values are allowed (in standard BST)\n* Each subtree is also a binary search tree\n\n## Basic Operations\n### 1. Insertion\n* Compare new value with root\n* If less, go to left subtree\n* If greater, go to right subtree\n* Repeat until finding empty spot\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\ndef insert(root, value):\n    if root is None:\n        return Node(value)\n    \n    if value < root.value:\n        root.left = insert(root.left, value)\n    elif value > root.value:\n        root.right = insert(root.right, value)\n    \n    return root\n```\n\n### 2. Search\n* Start at root\n* If target = current node, found!\n* If target < current node, search left subtree\n* If target > current node, search right subtree\n\n```python\ndef search(root, target):\n    if root is None or root.value == target:\n        return root\n    \n    if target < root.value:\n        return search(root.left, target)\n    return search(root.right, target)\n```\n\n## Time Complexity\n* Average case:\n    * Search: O(log n)\n    * Insert: O(log n)\n    * Delete: O(log n)\n* Worst case (unbalanced tree):\n    * All operations: O(n)\n\n## Common Applications\n* Implementing dictionaries\n* Database indexing\n* File system organization\n* Symbol tables in compilers\n\n## Advantages\n* Fast search, insertion, and deletion compared to arrays\n* Maintains sorted order of elements\n* Flexible size\n* Supports range queries efficiently\n\n## Disadvantages\n* Can become unbalanced, leading to poor performance\n* No constant-time operations\n* Requires additional memory for storing node pointers",
