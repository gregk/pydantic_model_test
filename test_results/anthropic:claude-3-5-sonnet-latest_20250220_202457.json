    "response": "# Binary Search Tree (BST)\n\n## Definition\nA Binary Search Tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, where each node contains a value and has up to two children (left and right). The tree follows specific ordering rules that make searching efficient.\n\n## Key Properties\n* Every node has at most two children\n* Left child contains a value less than the parent node\n* Right child contains a value greater than the parent node\n* Each subtree is also a binary search tree\n\n## Common Operations\n### 1. Insertion\n* Compare new value with root\n* If less, go left; if greater, go right\n* Repeat until finding empty spot\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, value):\n        self.value = value\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n\ndef insert(root, value):\n    if root is None:\n        return Node(value)\n    \n    if value < root.value:\n        root.left = insert(root.left, value)\n    else:\n        root.right = insert(root.right, value)\n    \n    return root\n```\n\n### 2. Search\n* Start at root\n* If target value matches current node, return true\n* If target is less, go left; if greater, go right\n* If leaf reached without match, return false\n\n```python\ndef search(root, target):\n    if root is None:\n        return False\n    \n    if root.value == target:\n        return True\n    \n    if target < root.value:\n        return search(root.left, target)\n    return search(root.right, target)\n```\n\n## Time Complexity\n* Average case: O(log n) for search, insert, delete\n* Worst case: O(n) if tree becomes unbalanced\n\n## Applications\n* Dictionary implementations\n* Database indexing\n* File system organization\n* Priority queues\n* Expression evaluation\n\n## Advantages\n* Fast search operations\n* Ordered traversal\n* Relatively simple implementation\n* Maintains sorted data structure\n\n## Disadvantages\n* Can become unbalanced\n* No constant-time operations\n* Not suitable for frequent insertions/deletions in middle\n\nRemember that maintaining balance in a BST is crucial for optimal performance. This is why balanced variants like AVL trees and Red-Black trees were developed.",

It includes type hints to specify that it accepts and returns numeric values (either integers or floats).\n\n```python\ndef add_numbers(x: float, y: float) -> float:\n    \"\"\"\n    Add two numbers together and return the sum.\n    \n    Args:\n        x (float): First number to add\n        y (float): Second number to add\n        \n    Returns:\n        float: Sum of the two numbers\n        \n    Example:\n        >>> add_numbers(5, 3)\n        8\n        >>> add_numbers(2.5, 4.7)\n        7.2\n    \"\"\"\n    return x + y\n```\n\n### Usage Example:\n```python\n# Adding integers\nresult1 = add_numbers(5, 3)\nprint(result1)  # Output: 8\n\n# Adding floating point numbers\nresult2 = add_numbers(2.5, 4.7)\nprint(result2)  # Output: 7.2\n```\n\nThe function is:\n- Simple and focused on a single task\n- Type-hinted for better code clarity\n- Documented with a clear docstring\n- Flexible enough to handle both integers and floating point numbers",
