Okay, so I have this problem here: If a train travels 120 kilometers in 2 hours, what is its speed in kilometers per hour? Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I remember that speed is generally about how fast something is moving. I think it's calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time it took. So, speed equals distance divided by time. That makes sense because if you go a certain distance in a given time, dividing them gives you a rate, which is speed.

So, in this problem, the distance is 120 kilometers, and the time is 2 hours. I need to find the speed. So, using the formula, I would take 120 km and divide it by 2 hours. Let me write that down: 120 รท 2. 

Wait, is that all? It seems pretty straightforward. Maybe I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes, problems can have tricks or require unit conversions, but here both are already in kilometers and hours, so no conversion needed. 

Let me think about the units. Kilometers per hour is the unit for speed here. So, when I divide kilometers by hours, the hours unit cancels out, leaving me with kilometers per hour, which is correct. 

I can also think about it in terms of multiples. If the train goes 120 km in 2 hours, then in one hour, it would go half that distance, right? Because 120 divided by 2 is 60. So, 60 km in one hour. That makes sense. 

Is there another way to approach this? Maybe using proportions or something. If in 2 hours, it's 120 km, then in 1 hour, it's x km. Setting up a proportion: 120 km / 2 hours = x km / 1 hour. Solving for x gives x = 60 km. Yeah, that checks out. 

I don't think I'm making any mistakes here. The calculation seems correct, and the logic makes sense. It's a basic division problem with straightforward unit handling. So, the speed should be 60 km/h. 

Just to be thorough, let me think of a real-life example. If a car travels 120 km in 2 hours, you'd say it's going 60 km/h, right? Because 60 times 2 is 120. That lines up with what I did here with the train. 

Alright, I feel confident about this. It's just a simple division without any complications. The answer should be 60 km/h.

To determine the speed of the train, we can use the basic formula for speed:

\[
\text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}}
\]

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Identify the Given Values:**
   - **Distance traveled by the train:** 120 kilometers
   - **Time taken to travel the distance:** 2 hours

2. **Plug the Values into the Speed Formula:**
   \[
   \text{Speed} = \frac{120 \text{ km}}{2 \text{ hours}}
   \]

3. **Perform the Division:**
   \[
   \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ km/h}
   \]

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The speed of the train is **60 kilometers per hour**.
