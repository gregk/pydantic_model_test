Okay, so I have this problem here: If a train travels 120 kilometers in 2 hours, what is its speed in kilometers per hour? Alright, let me try to figure this out step by step. 

First, I remember that speed is generally about how fast something is moving. I think it's calculated by dividing the distance traveled by the time it took. So, speed equals distance divided by time. That makes sense because if you go a certain distance in a given time, dividing them gives you a rate, which is speed.

So, in this problem, the distance is 120 kilometers, and the time is 2 hours. I need to find the speed. So, using the formula, I would take 120 km and divide it by 2 hours. Let me write that down: 120 รท 2. 

Wait, is that all? It seems pretty straightforward. Maybe I should double-check to make sure I'm not missing anything. Sometimes, problems can have tricks or require unit conversions, but here both are already in kilometers and hours, so no conversion needed. 

Let me think about the units. Kilometers per hour is the unit for speed here. So, when I divide kilometers by hours, the hours unit cancels out, leaving me with kilometers per hour, which is correct. 

I can also think about it in terms of multiples. If the train goes 120 km in 2 hours, then in one hour, it would go half that distance, right? Because 120 divided by 2 is 60. So, 60 km in one hour. That makes sense. 

Is there another way to approach this? Maybe using proportions or something. If in 2 hours, it's 120 km, then in 1 hour, it's x km. Setting up a proportion: 120 km / 2 hours = x km / 1 hour. Solving for x gives x = 60 km. Yeah, that checks out.

I think I'm confident now. The speed is 60 kilometers per hour. It all lines up when I break it down like this. No complicated steps, just a simple division and unit check.

# Step-by-Step Solution

## Step 1: Understand the Problem
We need to find the speed of a train that travels 120 kilometers in 2 hours.

## Step 2: Recall the Formula for Speed
Speed is calculated using the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

## Step 3: Plug in the Values
Given:
- Distance = 120 kilometers
- Time = 2 hours

Substitute these values into the formula:
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{120 \text{ km}}{2 \text{ hours}} \]

## Step 4: Perform the Calculation
\[ \text{Speed} = 60 \text{ km/h} \]

## Step 5: Final Answer
The speed of the train is **60 kilometers per hour**.
