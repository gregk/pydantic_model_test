Okay, I need to create a Python implementation of a key-value store based on the user's requirements. Let me break down what they asked for.

First, they want an abstract interface defining basic operations. So, I should create an abstract base class with methods like get, set, delete, and exists. Using abc module makes sense here. I'll also include type hints for clarity and docstrings for documentation.

Next, a local file-based implementation. I'll need to use JSON to serialize data. The data will be stored in a file, so I'll have to handle reading and writing. I should think about where to store this fileâ€”maybe a default directory like .kvstore. I'll need to handle exceptions, like when the directory doesn't exist, so I'll create it if it's missing. Also, I'll use thread locks to prevent race conditions when accessing the file.

Then, a Redis implementation. I'll use the redis-py library. This should be simpler since Redis handles concurrency better. I'll set up a connection pool and implement the same interface methods. I'll need to handle connection errors and ensure proper disconnection with a context manager.

I should structure the code into separate files as specified. Each implementation will import the interface and implement the abstract methods. Proper error handling is crucial, so I'll include try-except blocks and raise custom exceptions for things like connection issues or missing keys.

Finally, I'll format the response with markdown, showing each file in a code block with a brief explanation. I'll make sure to include type hints, docstrings, and example usages where applicable.

I think that covers all the requirements. Now, I'll write each file step by step, ensuring everything is properly implemented and documented.

            The value associated with the key, or None if the key does not exist.

### Explanation

1. **Interfaces (`key_value_store.py`)**:
   - Defines the abstract base class `KeyValueStore` with basic operations (`get`, `set`, `delete`, `exists`)
   - Uses type hints and docstrings for better code documentation

2. **Local Store (`local_store.py`)**:
   - Implements a file-based key-value store using JSON files
   - Handles concurrency with a thread lock
   - Stores data in a configurable directory (default: `~/.kvstore`)
   - Each key is stored in a separate JSON file

3. **Redis Store (`redis_store.py`)**:
   - Implements a Redis-based key-value store
   - Uses the `redis` library for Redis operations
   - Supports connection pooling and context manager
   - Handles connection errors and proper cleanup

Both implementations provide the same interface, making it easy to switch between different storage backends. The local store is suitable for development and small-scale use cases, while the Redis store is better for distributed and high-performance scenarios.
