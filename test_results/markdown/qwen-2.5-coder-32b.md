# Calculate the Speed of the Train

To find the speed of the train, we use the basic formula for speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

## Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify the given values:**
   - Distance (\(D\)) = 120 kilometers
   - Time (\(T\)) = 2 hours

2. **Substitute the values into the formula:**
   \[ \text{Speed} = \frac{120 \, \text{km}}{2 \, \text{hours}} \]

3. **Perform the division:**
   \[ \text{Speed} = 60 \, \frac{\text{km}}{\text{hour}} \]

4. **State the final answer with the appropriate unit:**
   - The speed of the train is 60 kilometers per hour.

## Conclusion
The train travels at a speed of 60 km/h.
