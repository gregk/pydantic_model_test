# Calculating the Speed of the Train

To find the speed of the train, we'll use the basic formula for speed:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} \]

Given:
- Distance traveled by the train = 120 kilometers
- Time taken = 2 hours

Let's break down the problem step by step.

## Step 1: Identify the Given Values
- Distance (D) = 120 km
- Time (T) = 2 hours

## Step 2: Apply the Formula
Use the speed formula by substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{120 \text{ km}}{2 \text{ hours}} \]

## Step 3: Calculate the Result
\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{120}{2} = 60 \]

## Step 4: Add the Unit
The speed is in kilometers per hour since the distance is in kilometers and the time is in hours.

# Final Answer:
The speed of the train is 60 kilometers per hour.
