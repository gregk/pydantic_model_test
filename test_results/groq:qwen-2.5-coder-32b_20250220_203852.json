Let's solve the problem 2 + 2 step by step using markdown format.\n\n### Problem: 2 + 2\n\n#### Step 1: Write down the numbers to be added.\nIn this case, we have the numbers 2 and 2.\n\n#### Step 2: Add the units (ones) place.\n- The ones place of 2 is 2.\n- The ones place of the second 2 is 2.\n\n  So, we add 2 + 2 = 4\n\n#### Step 3: Write down the sum.\nSince we are adding two single-digit numbers and the result is also a single-digit number, there is no need to carry over. The final result is the sum we calculated in Step 2.\n\n### Final Answer: 2 + 2 = 4\n\nIn markdown format, this would look as follows:\n\n```markdown\n### Problem: 2 + 2\n\n#### Step 1: Write down the numbers to be added.\nIn this case, we have the numbers 2 and 2.\n\n#### Step 2: Add the units (ones) place.\n- The ones place of 2 is 2.\n- The ones place of the second 2 is 2.\n\n  So, we add 2 + 2 = 4\n\n#### Step 3: Write down the sum.\nSince we are adding two single-digit numbers and the result is also a single-digit number, there is no need to carry over.

    "response": "# Binary Search Tree (BST)\n\nA Binary Search Tree (BST) is a node-based data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. For each node, the data in all nodes in the left subtree is less than the node\u2019s data and the data in all nodes in the right subtree is greater than the node\u2019s data.\n\n## Key Properties\n- Each node in the BST contains a key (or data), and two pointers to child nodes (left and right).\n- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node\u2019s key.\n- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node\u2019s key.\n- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.\n\n## Operations\nCommon operations on a BST include:\n- **Insertion**: Adding a new element to the tree.\n- **Deletion**: Removing an element from the tree.\n- **Search**: Finding an element with a specific key.\n- **Traversal**: Visiting all nodes in a particular order (in-order, pre-order, post-order).\n\n## Example of a Binary Search Tree\n\n```\n      8\n     / \\\n    3   10\n   / \\    \\\n  1   6    14\n     / \\   /\n    4   7 13\n```\n\n## Code Example\n\nHere is a simple implementation of a Binary Search Tree in Python with insertion and in-order traversal:\n\n```python\nclass Node:\n    def __init__(self, key):\n        self.left = None\n        self.right = None\n        self.val = key\n\nclass BinarySearchTree:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.root = None\n\n    def insert(self, key):\n        if self.root is None:\n            self.root = Node(key)\n        else:\n            self._insert(self.root, key)\n\n    def _insert(self, node, key):\n        if key < node.val:\n            if node.left is None:\n                node.left = Node(key)\n            else:\n                self._insert(node.left, key)\n        else:\n            if node.right is None:\n                node.right = Node(key)\n            else:\n                self._insert(node.right, key)\n\n    def inorder_traversal(self):\n        return self._inorder_traversal(self.root, [])\n\n    def _inorder_traversal(self, node, result):\n        if node is not None:\n            self._inorder_traversal(node.left, result)\n            result.append(node.val)\n            self._inorder_traversal(node.right, result)\n        return result\n\n# Example usage:\nbst = BinarySearchTree()\nbst.insert(8)\nbst.insert(3)\nbst.insert(10)\nbst.insert(1)\nbst.insert(6)\nbst.insert(14)\nbst.insert(4)\nbst.insert(7)\nbst.insert(13)\n\nprint(\"In-order traversal of the BST:\", bst.inorder_traversal())\n```\n\n**Output:**\n```\nIn-order traversal of the BST: [1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 13, 14]\n```\n\nIn this example, the `BinarySearchTree` class has methods to insert new keys and perform an in-order traversal which yields a sorted list of the keys in the tree.",

Below is a Python function that adds two numbers, formatted with explanations and code block in markdown.\n\n```markdown\n# Function to Add Two Numbers\n\nThis function takes two numbers as input and returns their sum.
